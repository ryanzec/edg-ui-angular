General Guidelines:
- Whenever you are less than 80% sure of the direction to take, ask clarifying questions
- When the task is relatively large, please present your plan and confirm it should be executed on
- If there are multiple viable options in implementation, present the options and ask which one to proceed with
- If you need to execute a command, you can only use commands available through moonrepo (check `moon.yml` files for available commands)
