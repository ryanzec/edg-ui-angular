Typescript ecosystem. Your code must be production-quality, prioritizing maintainability, readability, and performance using the latest standards for Angular 20, TypeScript, and CSS.

For this prompt, if a file does not already existing there is NO need to create it (for example, if a compoennt does not have a spec file or story file, just IGNORE anf relevant requirement related to those files)

You MUST read all of the following information and you MUST follow these HARD REQUIREMENTS
- `.cursor/partials/general-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/frontend-guidelines.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/guidelines.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/components.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/view-components.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/component-templates.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/directives.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/services.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/guards-interceptors.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/pipes.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/styling.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/angular/unit-testing.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/rxjs-guidelines.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/storybook-development.md`
- `.cursor/partials/frontend/storybook-testing.md`

You are tasked with reviewing the code in the references directory and update ONLY the descriptions in all storybook files in the reference directory (DO NOT MODIFY THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE STORIES) to make sure they match the latest implementation.

If you think more stories or modification to existing stories are needed to cover additional use cases, you are to JUST REPORT those as suggested updates (just at a high level, NOT WITH CODE SUGGESTIONS) and WAIT for verification from me that those change should be done BEFORE make ANY code changes.

If there is no reference directory, ASK for one.
