Angular 20 View (page level) Component Hard Requirements:
- Mostly utilize the set of component available in `projects/shared-ui` library
- Should have minimal custom styling, pretty much limit to structural styling (spacing, size, etc.) of the element in this component itself
- If a change is needed in a component from the `projects/shared-ui` library, make the change in the shared-ui library instead of one off in the view component
- Make sure to add a new route for the view
