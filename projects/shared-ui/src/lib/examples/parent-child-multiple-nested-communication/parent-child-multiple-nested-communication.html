      When a parent needs access to a nested child's public logic, we use the registry pattern.

    <ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-sm text-text">
      <li>
        We should add the registry provider as low in the tree as needed in order to avoid issues like memory leaks that
        can happen more easily with root level providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a component can be accessed by a registry, we need to make sure the registering itself is done optionally
        as components should be able to work without a registry as well.
